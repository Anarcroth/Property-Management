#Property Management

####A property management application. Allows for users to search a database and scroll through mutliple hpusing options. The users can rent or buy a property, can bid in the different places and filter out their search.

####How to install and run the program:

In order for you to run the app, clone the repository and `cd` into the directory.
After that open the project in your IDE (ex `IntelliJ`).
Make sure you have a maven installed, otherwise there is a chance that you will not be able to run the program.
If you do not have `maven` installed, send me a p.m. and I will package the project into a wrapper that will run the app without you having to install `maven`.

The `main` class of the project is the `PropertyManagerRun` class, which is a small boot that loads `Spring Boot` and all of its dependencies.
After the project loads and runs, you will see in the console window that you have a running instance of a `tomcat 8 serverlet` at port 8080 on your `localhost`.
